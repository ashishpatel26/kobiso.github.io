Cpasule Network is a new types of neural network proposed by Geoffrey Hinton and his team and presented in NIPS 2017.
As Geoffrey Hinton is Godfathers of Deep Learning, everyone in this field was crazy about this paper.
Moreover, the capsule network is proposed to solve problems of current convolutional neural network and achieves state-of-the-art performance on MNIST data set.
We are going to talk about how the capsule network works and what the difference between capsule network and CNN is.
