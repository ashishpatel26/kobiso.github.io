"U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation" is a famous segmentation model not only for biomedical tasks and also for general segmentation tasks, such as text, house, ship segmentation.

# Summary

- **Proposed Solution**
  - Present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently.
  - The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization.

- **Contribution**
  - U-net can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks.
  - It is fast, segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

## Network Architecture

U-net consits of a *contracting path (left side)* and an *expansive path (right side)*.

- **Contracting path**
  - typical architecture of a convolutional network
  - repeated application of two 3x3 convolutions (unpadded convolutions)
  - each followed by a rectified linear unit (ReLU) and a 2x2 max pooling operation with stride 2 for downsampling
  - at each downsampling step, we double the number of feature channels

- **Expansive path**
  - consists of an upsampling of the feature map followed by a 2x2 convolution ("up-convolution") that halves the number of feature channels
  - a concatenation with the correspondingly cropped feature map from the contracting path, and two 3x3 convolutions
  - each followed by a ReLU
  - the cropping is necessary due to the loss of border pixels in every convolution

At the final layer a 1x1 convolution is used to map each 64-component feature vector to the desired number of classes.
In total the network has 23 convolutional layers.

## Training

The energy function is computed by a pixel-wise soft-max over the final feature map combined with the cross entropy loss function.
The soft-max is defined as

$$
p_k(x)=exp(a_k(x))/(\sum_{k'=1}^Kexp(a_{k'}(x)))
$$

The cross entropy then penalizes at each position the deviation of $$p_{l(x)}(x)$$ from 1 using

$$
E = \sum_{x\in Î©}w(x)log(p_{l(x)}(x))
$$


The seperation border is computed using *morphological operations*.
The weight map is then computed as

$$
w(x) = w_c(x) + w_0 \cdot exp(-\frac{(d_1(x)+d_2(x))^2}{2\sigma^2})
$$
